1	96	362	   complete process is described with the examples
1	96	380	   of a bar plot and a scatter plot illustrating the leg-
1	96	398	   endary puzzle of African and European swallows’
1	96	416	   migrations.
1	82	519	Unlike statistical software based on a Graphical User
1	82	537	Interface (GUI ), such as Minitab® or Stata®, the R
1	82	555	language allows you to control exactly how your data
1	82	572	will be displayed. This comes at a cost: you must
1	82	590	know the exact arguments of the commands to get
1	82	608	the result you want.
1	105	628	    In this context, beginners find that drawing elabo-
1	82	646	rate graphs is often a long and difficult process made
1	82	664	up of lots of trials and slight code modifications. Some
1	82	754	mainly an explorative function in data analysis, and
1	82	772	are not customizable to get publication-ready mate-
1	82	790	rial.
1	105	810	    Therefore, many R users, especially beginners (but
1	82	828	not only), go back to Excel®-like software and their
1	82	846	clickable interfaces to quickly draw the graphs they
1	82	864	want to publish. In the compromise between speed
1	82	882	and simplicity vs. graph quality, they must sacrifice
1	82	900	graph quality in the process. This is regrettable, be-
1	82	918	cause R can do lots of things Excel® cannot, by com-
1	82	936	bining high and low-level graphical functions. The
1	82	971	fore to combine the simplicity of a GUI with the pow-
1	82	989	erful capabilities and the graphical quality of R.

1	82	1063	of the variables to be represented and the configura-
1	82	1081	tion of all graphical options are made with menus,
1	82	1099	checkboxes and other clickable tools.
1	105	1119	    The visual structure and functioning of the GUI
1	82	1137	are entirely based on the tcltk package developed by
1	82	1173	the Tcl/Tk language to R.
1	481	306	    Launching the interface is the only step that re-

1	496	496	      buttons, each corresponding to one (obligatory
1	496	514	      or optional) step of the process. From left to
1	496	531	       right:
1	506	561	       A. Loading and modifying the dataset.
1	509	585	        B. Setting up a graph. From left to right: his-
1	529	603	           togram, box-and-whisker plot, bar plot, pie
1	529	621	            chart, curve and scatter plot.
1	507	644	       C. Opening a new graphics device: when a
1	529	662	           graph is drawn, it is in the active window
1	529	680	            or in a new device if none is open. This but-
1	529	698	           ton allows the user to open a new graph-
1	529	716	           ics device in which several graphs can be
1	529	734	         drawn.
1	506	758	       D. Draw a graph.
1	509	782	        E. Adding elements to the graph. From left
1	529	799	           to right: add a horizontal line, add a ver-
1	529	817	           tical line, add any other kind of line, add
1	529	835	           a theoretical distribution curve, add text,
1	529	853	          and add p-values.

1	506	901	       G. Divers options: user language and help.
1	478	930	   2. The messages frame: when the mouse is over
1	496	948	      some specific elements of the GUI or when some
1	496	966	      specific actions are performed, messages are dis-
1	496	984	      played in this frame. Three kinds of message
1	496	1002	      can be displayed:
1	529	1073	           tention should be paid to a specific point
1	529	1091	            (for example: if this option is chosen, then
1	529	1109	            this one can not be),
1	529	1151	           tion requested can not be completed. The

2	101	541	    3. The settings block: it is divided into four to six
2	120	559	      sub-blocks, each containing options relating to
2	120	577	      a given theme: general parameters of the graph,
2	120	595	       title of the graph, legend. . . Each sub-block can
2	120	613	      be opened or closed with the corresponding ar-
2	120	631	      row situated on the right of the interface. Of
2	120	649	      course, defined settings are not lost when a sub-
2	120	667	       block is closed.
2	82	757	The examples shown here are based on the dataset
2	82	775	provided in the package, called ‘Swallows’. To load
2	82	793	it, use the command data(Swallows). This (fictional!)
2	82	811	dataset exemplifies the legendary puzzle of African
2	82	942	dataset. Data can be imported from an external file
2	82	978	be an already existing R object of class "data.frame"
2	105	1015	    The next sub-block allows you to get informa-
2	82	1033	tion on the dataset structure. When a variable is se-
2	82	1051	lected in the list on the left, its type (numeric, factor,
2	82	1087	frame on the right.
2	105	1105	    The next two sub-blocks allow the dataset to be
2	82	1123	modified if needed:
2	103	1155	   • by renaming variables (for example if the    (you can try to do it, the dataset contains a ‘Sex’ fac-
2	120	1173	      dataset does not contain their names),
2	480	541	    • by converting variables into factors. The con-
2	496	559	      version can be applied to variables of class
2	496	595	      case values can be grouped into classes). The
2	496	613	      latter case is necessary when a factor is numeri-
2	496	631	      cally coded, e.g. a binary factor (0/1), otherwise
2	496	649	      R would treat it as a numeric variable.
2	459	724	Once the dataset is ready, click on the button corre-
2	459	742	sponding to the type of graph to be drawn (histogram,
2	459	760	box-and-whisker plot, bar plot, pie chart, curve or
2	459	777	scatter plot).
2	481	796	    Whatever the type of graph chosen, all parame-
2	459	814	ters have a default value except general parameters –
2	459	850	Hence, to quickly draw a graph, only general param-
2	459	868	eters must be defined. If they are not (or not all) de-
2	459	885	fined, an error occurs when trying to draw the graph.
2	481	904	    Here the aim is to draw two graphs: a barplot dis-
2	459	940	swallows, and a scatter plot displaying the relation-
2	459	958	ship between weight and size in the two species. Let’s
2	459	975	begin with the barplot. We start by clicking on the
2	481	1012	    We want to show mean sizes of swallows depend-
2	459	1030	ing on their species. In the general parameters, we
2	459	1048	hence choose the ‘Means’ type (bar plots can also dis-
2	459	1083	resented and ‘Species’ as the obligatory factor (Fig-
2	459	1119	for example we would like to display mean sizes of
2	459	1137	swallows depending on their species and their sex
2	459	1173	tor).

5	105	125	    Graph title and axis legends are optional (no text is
5	82	143	written by default). In our example we call our graph
5	80	161	‘Mean size comparison’ and name the axes ‘Species’
5	82	179	(horizontal axis) and ‘Size (cm)’ (vertical axis). Bar
5	82	197	names are by default the names of the correspond-
5	82	215	ing levels of factor 1. However we could change this,
5	82	233	which would only change the names displayed on the
5	82	251	graph (and not the ones in the dataset). This allows
5	82	268	you to use names containing several words, spaces or
5	82	286	accents on your graph (which is either impossible or
5	82	304	strongly discouraged for object names).
5	105	323	    Lower and upper limits of the vertical axis can
5	82	341	be changed, and a logarithmic scale can be used. If
5	82	359	limit values are left on ‘Auto’, GrapheR will adjust
5	82	377	them automatically. Here the lower limit is left on
5	80	395	‘Auto’, whilst the upper limit is set to ‘23’, for reasons
5	82	413	explained later.
5	105	431	    If no second factor is defined, all bars are by de-
5	82	449	fault solid white with a black border and no hatchings.
5	82	467	We can set these three parameters (bar color, border
5	82	485	color and hatchings), but in this example we simply
5	82	503	change bar color to a classic grey. If a second factor is
5	82	521	defined, one color/hatching pattern can be attributed
5	82	539	by level of this factor. In this case colors are by default
5	82	557	set to different shades of grey (borders are always
5	82	574	black). Bars can be stacked in this situation, but if you
5	82	592	choose this option, no error bar can be drawn.
5	105	611	    Means and percentages in scientific bar plots are
5	82	629	nearly always supplied with error bars, but getting
5	82	647	those bars right using the command line is notori-
5	82	665	ously challenging for R beginners. GrapheR makes
5	82	683	it easy to draw error bars to represent either the stan-
5	82	701	dard deviation, the standard error of the mean or the
5	82	718	95% confidence interval of the mean. Here we choose
5	82	736	for example ‘standard errors’.
5	105	755	    When a second factor is defined, a legend box can
5	82	773	be added to the graph. Its items are by default the
5	82	791	levels of this factor. As for bar names, legend items
5	82	809	can be renamed, which will not change actual level
5	82	827	names in the dataset. A title can also be added to the
5	82	845	legend. Finally, its position on the graph can be set.
5	105	863	    Once all options have been thus configured, just
5	82	881	click on the ‘DRAW’ button of the navigation bar. . . et
5	82	899	voilà! By default the graph is produced in the active
5	82	917	graphics device, but here we want to display two
5	82	935	graphs in the same window. Hence we click on the
5	80	953	‘window’ button of the navigation bar before drawing
5	82	971	our bar plot.
5	82	1047	A dialog box opens on the right of the interface, allow-
5	82	1065	ing specification of the number of graphs to be drawn
5	82	1083	in the device to be created, and the background color

5	82	1137	device, shared between four rows and four columns.    want, customize its size and color if needed, and fi-
5	82	1155	However, the larger the number of graphs to be
5	82	1173	drawn, the smaller the space allocated to each.
5	495	476	      Figure 4: Opening a new graphics device
5	481	513	    After creating the new graphics device, we can
5	459	531	draw our graph by clicking on the ‘DRAW’ button.
5	459	615	Once the graph is drawn, elements can be added to
5	459	633	complete it:
5	480	667	    • one or several horizontal line(s)
5	480	703	    • one or several vertical line(s)
5	480	739	    • any other kind of line(s)
5	480	775	    • one or several theoretical distribution curve(s):
5	496	793	      only on density histograms
5	480	829	    • text
5	480	865	    • p-values: only on bar plots
5	481	900	    These elements are always added to the last graph
5	459	917	drawn.
5	481	937	    For each element, clicking on the corresponding
5	459	955	button in the navigation bar opens a dialog box on
5	459	973	the right of the interface.
5	481	992	    In our bar plot example, let’s assume that we had
5	459	1010	used R beforehand to perform a statistical test to com-
5	458	1028	                                                      pare the sizes of our two species. We can now use
5	459	1046	the p-values tool to add the result of this test on the
5	459	1064	graph: just click on the ‘p-val’ button.
5	481	1083	    Two designs are available, depending on the num-
5	459	1119	design, the process is the same: enter the text you
5	459	1155	nally click on the ‘Select’ button. Then just click on
5	459	1173	the bars to be compared on the graph.

6	119	454	      Figure 5: Adding p-values to the bar plot
6	105	491	    The result, sometimes, will not look good the first
6	82	509	time. It is because there was not enough space above
6	82	527	the bars to add text. If you want to add text above
6	82	545	your graph, remember to allow some space by setting
6	82	563	a higher upper limit for the vertical axis (this is the

6	82	718	The second graph we want to draw is a scatter plot dis-
6	82	736	playing the relationship between weight and size in
6	105	791	    In the general parameters, we define ‘Weight’ as
6	458	125	                                                          To draw a scatter plot by species, we add an optional
6	459	143	factor, ‘Species’, and select its two levels from the list.
6	459	161	Finally, for aesthetic reasons we choose to draw a box
6	459	179	around the graph by ticking the ‘Box’ checkbox.
6	481	197	   We add a title for the graph (‘Weight - size
6	459	233	and for the vertical axis (‘Size (cm)’).
6	481	251	    For each scatter plot, a different point symbol (as
6	458	268	                                                           well as its color and size) can be defined. By default
6	459	286	all symbols are empty circles. When only one scatter
6	458	304	                                                           plot is drawn the default color is black, whereas when
6	459	322	several are drawn colors are set to different shades of
6	459	340	grey. Here we choose full circles for the two scatter
6	458	358	                                                       plots and change only the second color (correspond-
6	459	376	ing to the ‘European’ level) to a dark red.
6	481	394	    A line/curve can be added by scatter plot, chosen
6	459	412	among different types:
6	480	441	    • a linear regression line (performed with the least
6	496	459	      squares method)
6	480	488	    • a linear regression line (performed with the least
6	496	506	      rectangles method)
6	480	536	    • a quadratic regression line
6	480	565	   • a simple tendency curve
6	459	594	Here no variable is independent or dependent, but
6	459	612	both are interdependent. We hence choose to add a
6	459	630	linear regression line performed with the least rect-
6	459	648	angles method to each scatter plot. Among the three
6	459	666	available line types (full, large dashed or fine dashed),
6	481	701	    We add a legend box by ticking the ‘Add a legend’
6	459	719	checkbox. We give it a title (‘Species’) and set its po-
6	459	737	sition to ‘top - left’. We leave the default items,
6	459	773	general parameters.
6	481	791	    Finally, we click on the ‘DRAW’ button of the navi-

8	82	752	terface is closed and re-opened in the chosen language
8	82	770	(but note that any dataset loaded in the previous lan-
8	82	788	guage session is lost and has to be re-loaded).
8	130	1042	       Figure 9: Changing the user language
8	82	1155	Implementing GrapheR in another language is very
8	82	1173	easy, because no word appearing in the interface is
8	459	143	an external file which is loaded depending on the lan-
8	459	161	guage setting. In the current version (1.9-66), only En-
8	481	215	    Therefore, adding a new language just requires
8	459	233	a (strict) translation of each line of one of the exist-
8	459	251	ing files (including spaces before and/or after words).
8	481	287	    If you want to implement GrapheR in your lan-
8	459	305	guage, you are most welcome. In that case, remember
8	459	322	that it would be a good idea (but a tougher job) to
8	459	358	directory). If you want to participate, do not hesitate
8	459	376	to contact me. I will take care of all screenshots to be
8	459	394	included in the manual, and then add the link to the
8	459	412	new language file in the code.

1	82	344	Microarray experiments are becoming more and
1	82	362	more popular and critical in many biological disci-
1	82	380	plines. As in any statistical experiment, appropriate
1	82	398	experimental design is essential for reliable statisti-
1	82	415	cal inference, and sample size has a crucial role in ex-
1	82	433	perimental design. Because microarray experiments
1	82	451	are rather costly, it is important to have an adequate
1	82	469	sample size that will achieve a desired power with-
1	82	487	out wasting resources.
1	105	506	    For a given microarray data set, thousands of
1	82	524	hypotheses, one for each gene, are simultaneously
1	82	560	trolling false discovery rate (FDR) is more reasonable
1	82	578	and more powerful than controlling family-wise er-
1	82	596	ror rate (FWER) in genomic data. However, the most
1	82	614	common procedure used to calculate sample size in-
1	82	631	volves controlling FWER, not FDR.
1	82	668	quick sample size calculation for microarray experi-
1	82	686	ments while controlling FDR. In this paper, we intro-
1	82	704	duce the R package ssize.fdr which implements the
1	82	740	package can be applied for designing one-sample,
1	82	758	two-sample, or multi-sample experiments. The prac-
1	82	776	titioner defines the desired power, the level of FDR
1	82	794	to control, the proportion of non-differentially ex-
1	82	812	pressed genes, as well as effect size and variance.
1	82	830	More specifically, the effect size and variance can be
1	82	847	set as fixed or random quantities coming from appro-
1	82	865	priate distributions. Based on user-defined parame-
1	82	883	ters, this package creates plots of power vs. sample
1	82	901	size. These plots allow for visualization of trade-offs
1	82	919	between power and sample size, in addition to the
1	82	937	changes between power and sample size when the
1	82	955	user-defined quantities are modified.

1	459	446	gion of the test. For each proposed hypothesis (test)
1	459	464	with given user-defined quantities, the sample size is

1	459	690	error and power of the test, respectively.
1	459	775	The package ssize.fdr has six functions which in-
1	459	793	cludes three new functions that have recently been
1	459	811	developed as well as three functions translated from
1	459	829	the previous available Matlab codes. The six func-
1	459	847	tions and their descriptions are listed below.

2	82	345	croarray experiments, respectively, for fixed effect
2	82	363	size (delta) and standard deviation (sigma). For one-
2	82	380	sample designs, the effect size is defined as the dif-
2	82	398	ference in the true mean expression level and its pro-
2	82	416	posed value under the null hypothesis for each gene.
2	82	434	For two-sample designs, the effect size is defined
2	82	452	as the difference in mean expression levels between
2	82	470	treatment groups for each gene. In the two-sample
2	82	488	case, sigma is the pooled standard deviation of treat-
2	82	506	ment expression levels.

2	82	578	in which effect sizes and standard deviations vary

2	82	614	to follow a normal distribution with mean deltaMean
2	82	632	and standard deviation deltaSE, while variances (the
2	82	650	square of the standard deviations) among genes are
2	82	668	assumed to follow an Inverse Gamma distribution

2	82	741	inputs include the design matrix (X), the parameter

2	82	776	trasts of interest (L), a function of n for the degrees
2	82	794	of freedom of the experimental design (dn), and the
2	82	812	pooled standard deviation of treatment expression

2	82	1011	available, a guess based on a biological system un-
2	82	1029	der study could be used. In this case, we recommend
2	82	1065	that the desired power will still be achieved. The in-
2	82	1101	lations are performed for each element of the vector.
2	82	1119	This allows one to assess the changes of power due
2	105	1155	    For functions that assume variances follow an In-
2	82	1173	verse Gamma distribution, it is important to note
2	481	180	    Each function outputs the following results: a
2	459	198	plot of power vs. sample size, the smallest sample
2	459	216	size that achieves the desired power, a table of cal-
2	459	234	culated powers for each sample size, and a table of
2	459	252	calculated critical values for each sample size.
2	459	349	Unless otherwise noted, all data sets analyzed in this
2	459	489	To illustrate the use of the functions ssize.oneSamp
2	459	543	are used to study early development in vertebrates.
2	459	560	Swirl is a point mutation in the BMP2 gene in ze-
2	459	578	brafish that affects the dorsal/ventral body axis. The
2	459	596	goal of this experiment is to identify gene expres-
2	459	614	sion levels that differ between zebrafish with the
2	459	632	swirl mutation and wild-type zebrafish. This data
2	459	650	set (Swirl) includes 8448 gene expression levels from
2	459	668	both types of the organism. The experimental de-
2	459	686	sign includes two sets of dye-swap pairs. For more
2	459	704	details on the microarray technology used and the
2	459	722	experimental design of this experiment, see Smyth
2	459	740	(2004). The limma package performs both normal-
2	459	758	ization and analysis of microarray data sets. See Sec-
2	459	794	of the Swirl data set, along with the R code for this
2	459	812	analysis.
2	481	831	    After normalizing the data, the limma package is
2	459	849	applied to test if genes are differentially expressed
2	459	903	of mean gene expressions between swirl mutant ze-
2	459	921	brafish and the wild type zebrafish are significantly
2	459	938	different from zero or not. We then apply the qvalue
2	459	956	function (in the qvalue package) to the vector of p-
2	459	992	mated to be 0.63.
2	481	1012	    Now suppose we are interested in performing a
2	459	1030	similar experiment and want to find an appropri-
2	459	1048	ate sample size to use. We want to be able to de-
2	459	1065	tect a two-fold change in expression levels between
2	459	1083	the two genotypes, corresponding to a difference in
2	459	1137	tests will be two-sided. We also want to obtain 80%
2	459	1155	power while controlling FDR at 5%. We will use the
3	790	67	                                             49
3	82	143	size.
3	82	179	use of the ssize.oneSamp function, we need to assign
3	82	197	a common value for the standard deviations of all
3	82	233	standard deviations from the swirl experiment. This
3	82	251	value is 0.44. It is important to note that power cal-
3	82	268	culations will be overestimated for genes with higher
3	82	286	standard deviation than this. Similarly, power will be
3	82	304	conservative for genes with smaller standard devia-
3	82	322	tion than 0.44. To calculate appropriate sample sizes
3	82	340	using ssize.oneSamp, the following code is used.
3	82	809	Figure 1: Sample size vs. power for one-sample two-
3	82	827	sided t-test with effect size of one, standard deviation
3	82	845	of 0.44, and various proportions of non-differentially
3	82	863	expressed genes with FDR controlled at 5%.
3	105	897	    We see that appropriate samples sizes are 4, 5,
3	82	933	0.50, 0.63, 0.75, and 0.90. Notice that although a
3	82	951	sample size of five was calculated to be adequate
3	82	987	ment, so it is better to have an even number of slides.
3	82	1005	Because of this, we recommend six slides for a dye-
3	82	1023	swap experiment with two pairs. Sample size infor-
3	82	1041	mation, along with the calculated powers and critical
3	82	1059	values can be obtained using the following code.
3	82	1173	pose we are interested in representing the standard
3	459	125	deviations of the log ratios more precisely. This can
3	459	161	models the variances of normalized expression lev-
3	459	179	els as
3	459	342	equivalent to
3	459	486	ing the lmFit and eBayes functions in the limma
3	459	522	croarray data set. For the Swirl data set, these val-
3	459	576	of the log ratios follow an Inverse Gamma distribu-
3	459	594	tion with shape parameter 2.09 and scale parame-
3	459	612	ter 0.106. From this information, we find appropri-
3	459	629	ate sample sizes for a future experiment using the
3	459	819	power versus sample size for each proportion of
3	459	837	non-differentially expressed genes that was input.
3	459	855	Note that we are simply interested in finding genes
3	459	873	that have a two-fold change in expression levels, so
3	459	891	we want the effect size to be held constant at one.
3	459	909	This is done by setting the mean of the effect sizes
3	459	927	(deltaMean) at the desired value with standard devi-
3	459	945	ation (deltaSE) equal to zero.
3	459	988	ple sizes are 3, 4, 4, and 5, respectively, to achieve
3	459	1006	80% average power with a FDR of 5%. These values
3	459	1024	are smaller than those in the previous example. In
3	459	1042	order to obtain appropriate sample size information
3	459	1060	more directly, along with the calculated powers and
3	459	1078	critical values, use the following code.

4	82	500	sided t-test with effect size of one and various pro-
4	82	518	portions of non-differentially expressed genes with
4	82	536	FDR controlled at 5%. Variances are assumed to fol-
4	82	554	low an Inverse Gamma(2.09, 0.106) distribution.
4	82	651	In order to illustrate the uses of the ssize.twoSamp
4	82	669	and ssize.twoSampVary functions, another data ex-
4	82	705	gene plays an important role in high density lipopro-
4	82	723	tein (HDL) metabolism, as mice with this gene
4	82	741	knocked out have very low HDL levels. The goal
4	82	759	of this study is to determine how the absence of the
4	82	777	ApoAI gene affects other genes in the liver. In order
4	82	794	to do this, gene expression levels of ApoAI knockout
4	82	812	mice and control mice were compared using a com-
4	82	848	in-depth description of the study. This is an exam-
4	82	866	ple of a two sample microarray experiment. For full
4	82	884	analysis of this data sets using the limma package,
4	105	921	    Similar to the previous example, the limma pack-
4	82	939	age is applied to analyze the data. From the resulting
4	82	957	p-values, we use the qvalue function to estimate the
4	82	1012	use of the ssize.twoSamp function, we can choose a
4	82	1030	common value to represent the standard deviation
4	82	1048	for all genes. Similar to the ssize.oneSamp example,
4	82	1083	standard deviations. In this case, this value is 0.42.
4	82	1101	Again assume we are interested in genes showing a
4	82	1119	two-fold change, but this time we are only concerned
4	82	1137	with up-regulated genes, so we will be performing
4	82	1155	a one-sided upper tail t-test for each gene. We also
4	82	1173	want to achieve 80% power while controlling FDR at
4	459	125	5%. The ssize.twoSamp function can be used to cal-
4	459	143	culate an appropriate sample size for a simliar exper-
4	459	161	iment with the following code. This code also pro-
4	459	646	Figure 3: Sample size vs. power for two-sample one-
4	459	664	sided upper t-test with effect size of one, standard
4	459	682	deviation of 0.42, and various proportions of non-
4	459	699	differentially expressed genes with FDR controlled at
4	459	717	5%.
4	459	766	sizes are 4, 5, 6, and 7 for each genotype group for
4	459	802	lated critical values and power along with the sam-
4	459	820	ple size estimates can be obtained with the following
4	459	838	code.
4	459	1002	variances of the gene expression levels follow an In-
4	459	1020	verse Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1.94
4	459	1038	and scale parameter 0.10. With these values, we can
4	459	1056	use the ssize.twoSampVary function to calculate ap-
4	459	1074	propriate sample sizes for experiments for detecting
4	459	1092	a fold change of one in up-regulated genes. We also
4	459	1110	want our results to have at least 80% average power
4	459	1128	with FDR conrolled at 5%.

5	82	722	estimates, the following code can be used.
5	82	850	Lastly, we will use data from an experiment with
5	82	868	a 2x2 factorial design to illustrate the uses of the
5	82	904	case are gene expression levels from MCF7 breast
5	82	922	cancer cells obtained from Affymetrix HGV5av2 mi-
5	82	940	croarrays. The two treatment factors are estrogen
5	82	958	(present/absent) and exposure length (10 hours/48
5	82	976	hours), and the goal of this experiment is to identify
5	82	994	genes that respond to an estrogen treatment and clas-
5	82	1012	sify these genes as early or late responders. Data for
5	82	1030	this experiment can be found in the estrogen pack-
5	82	1065	full analysis of this data set using the limma package
5	82	1083	and more details of the experiment, see Section 11.4
5	105	1119	    Because there are two factors with two levels
5	82	1137	each, there are a total of four treatments, and we de-
5	82	1173	ues for a given gene g in the table below. In this table,
5	459	143	levels for cells with no estrogen at 10 hours, τ rep-
5	459	161	resents the effect of time in the absence of estrogen,

5	459	565	effect of estrogen and how this changes over time, we
5	459	583	only care about the parameters α and γ. Thus, we let

6	82	708	ues of 0.9, 0.944, 0.975, and 0.995, respectively. It is
6	82	725	important to note that in this experiment, one sam-
6	82	743	ple includes a set of four gene chips (one for each
6	82	761	treatment). So a sample size of 4 would require a to-
6	82	779	tal of 16 chips, with 4 for each of the four treatment

6	459	850	sumption that at least one parameter is random. Cur-
6	459	868	rently, these assumptions are that effect sizes follow
6	459	886	Normal distributions and variances follow Inverse
6	459	904	Gamma distributions. If users desire to assume that
6	459	922	parameters follow other distributions, the code can
